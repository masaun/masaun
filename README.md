## Hi there üëã

I'm a blockchain developer who implement a smart contract in Solidity with Foundry, Hardhat on Ethereum and EVM compatible chains.

I'm also a ZK developer who implement a ZK circuit in [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/), [Circom](https://iden3.io/circom), zkVM (i.e. [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/introduction), [RISC Zero](https://risczero.com/)) and integrate these ZK (Zero-Knowledge) implementation with a smart contract on blockchain.
